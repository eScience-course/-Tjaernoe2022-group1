    "Predicting the future of Earth's changing climate is a vital need that requires models providing accurate and trustworthy expectations of future conditions, so that actions may be taken to avoid adverse scenarios * . This is most true in the Artic where temperatures have been increasing at up to three times the average global rates encouraged by positive feedbacks * . Many of these are positive and leading to increased warming, for example increased temperatures leading to lower sea ice cover, causing lower average surface albedo, in turn leading to further warming via decreased reflected solar radiation * . Some are negative feedbacks and could help the climate remain in a more \"normal\" state by slowing the ongoing warming. One such feedback is the indirect impact of aerosols due to low-level clouds' cooling effect as they reflect and scatter more light before it can reach Earth's surface * . Modelling these clouds correctly is very important in painting a clearer picture for the future of a rapidly changing Arctic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling clouds is not as simple as just calculating the presence and height of clouds. The properties of clouds such as the brightness, cloud droplet size, and water vs ice crystal characteristics are integral in them being either net warming or net cooling * . Even when using the same sets of models, cloud feedbacks can be drastically different depending on the conditions portraied. This was show when Pithan and Mauritsen * found arctic clouds to have a slight positive feedback whilst Zelinka et al. * showed Arctic clouds to have a negative feedback despite using the same set of models. An element that influences these cloud properties is the number and composition of particles forming the cloud as well as their make up * . Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) being precursors to cloud droplets (by having the potential to become activated cloud droplets), are therefore essential to properly modelling cloud properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of aerosol particles above the size of 50 and 100 nanometers (N50 and N100 respectively), can be used as an accurate proxy of CCN concentrations * . This is because the larger particles will become activated first as they require a lower super saturation to start growing. CCN additionally vary largely based on their source and their composition. In the Arctic, where the number of aerosols present can be limiting * , the creation of aerosols is highly linked to the formation and properties of clouds. Sulphate is important in lining insoluble aerosols in order to make them soluble * aiding in new particle formation and aerosol size growth * . Sea Spray is another significant source of aerosol particles in the arctic. As their size is quite large, *in the accumulation mode*, they are important for developing clouds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models have become complex enough to simulate fine aspects of Earth's atmosphere such as the source and size of aerosols, as well as atmospheric processes which lead to cloud formation. However, due to the complex nature of these interactions, it is necessary to evaluate how accurately models portrait the concentrations of these aerosol species that form the base of the cloud formation process. This investigation aims to access the accuracy of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) by comparing its results to observation data, using the Zeppelin weather station in Ny-Ã…lesund as the study site.
